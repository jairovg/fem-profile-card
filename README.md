## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

According to the mentoring session, it would be good to handle new challenges with CSS grid only.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I always redirect to this usefull resource in mentoring sessions.
- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - I'm going to learn CSS grid and found this version in CSS tricks.
